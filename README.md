## `halp` (WIP)

Have you ever experienced this:

```sh
$ some_tool -v
unknown flag -v

$ some_tool -V
unknown flag -V

$ some_tool -h
unknown flag -h

$ asdjw1jwhdajh1idojad # frustration
bash: asdjw1jwhdajh1idojad: command not found

$ some_tool --help
Some CLI Tool Version 1.42.69
Usage:
  some_tool <flags> <args> [--parameter1 value1 --parameter2 value2 ...]

# f*cking finally!
```

`halp` aims to help with this and other different cases.
